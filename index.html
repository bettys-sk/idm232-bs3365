<h1>Recipe Room Case Study</h1>

<h2>The Overview</h2>
    <p class="p-space">This project was an 11-week solo assignment to turn a collection of static recipe PDFs into a user-friendly online cookbook built with PHP and MySQL. 
        The main challenge was creating a searchable, filterable system that made the recipes easy to browse and follow. I designed the visual style, structured the data, 
        built the database in phpMyAdmin, and developed the front end and back end to work smoothly together.</p>
    <p class="p-space">The final site is a clean, fully functioning recipe library that pulls all content dynamically.Through this process, I gained strong hands-on experience 
        with server-side development, database design, and building a complete online recipe collection from scratch.</p>

<h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
    <h3 class="p-c-t-space">Background / Description / Timeline / Purpose</h3>
        <p class="p-c-space">This project was created as part of my IDM232: Web Scripting II course. Over an 11-week semester, I was tasked with building a full recipe website using PHP, 
            MySQL, and tools introduced throughout the course.</p>
        <p class="p-b-space">The goal was to create a branded online cookbook where users could browse, search, and filter a collection of pre-written recipes. There was no formal budget since 
            this was a class assignment, but the project simulated a real client brief by requiring full functionality, visual consistency, and clean backend logic.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p class="p-c-space">The project exists to solve one core problem:</p>
        <div class="li-space-1">
            <li>How can we turn a static set of PDFs and images into a dynamic, easy-to-navigate recipe experience?</li>
        </div>
    <p class="p-c-space">Before the project, the recipes only existed as loose files. They weren’t searchable, filterable, or organized in a way that users could interact with easily. 
        The challenge was to transform this information into a real web application where people could:</p>
        <div class="li-space-2">
            <li>Quickly browse multiple recipes</li>
            <li>Filter based on category</li>
            <li>Search</li>
            <li>View each recipe in a clean, readable layout</li>            
        </div>

<h3>Goals & Objectives</h3>
    <p class="p-c-space">These were the goals that defined project success:</p>
        <div class="li-space-1">
            <li>The site should let users browse, search, and filter recipes without errors</li>
            <li>Recipes should be easy to read and navigate</li>
            <li>All recipe data should pull correctly from the database using PHP and SQL queries</li>
            <li>Pages should load reliably and handle form inputs smoothly</li>
            <li>The site should feel branded and cohesive</li>
        </div>
    <p class="p-c-space">Success was defined by whether the site worked end-to-end and created a clear improvement over the original PDFs.</p>

    <p class="p-b-space">This was a solo project, created over 11 weeks. I was responsible for everything, from planning and data structure to frontend design and backend development. The main goal was 
        to build a working recipe website that solved usability problems and demonstrated strong technical execution.</p>

<h2>Process and Insight</h2>
    <h3 class="p-c-t-space">Moodboarding & Visual Direction</h3>
    <img class="process" src="./images/moodboard.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="p-b-p-space">I began by gathering inspiration for the look and feel of the site. I explored color palettes, typography styles, and examples of clean recipe layout patterns. 
            This helped me decide the tone as simple, friendly, and easy to scan.</p>

<h3>Creating the Style Sheet</h3>
    <img class="process" src="./images/stylesheet.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="p-c-space">After setting the overall mood and style direction, I created a simple styling sheet to guide the look of the site. This included my chosen fonts, color palette, icon style, 
        and general spacing rules. With this foundation in place, I moved directly into building the initial HTML templates for both the main index page and the individual recipe pages.</p>
    <p class="p-b-p-space">The styling sheet kept everything consistent, while the templates served as early structural layouts, and used them as placeholders where all the dynamic content 
        from the database would eventually plug in. This step helped me see how the visual system and page structure would work together once the backend was connected.</p>

<h3>Cleaning, Structuring, and Building the Database</h3>
    <img class="process" src="./images/database.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="p-c-space">After designing the layout, I moved into preparing the actual recipe content. I started by gathering all of the provided recipe PDFs and images, then cleaned and 
        sorted everything in my local folders. Each recipe had to be broken down into consistent parts, so I reformatted the text into clear sections like title, bio, ingredients, cook time, 
        and steps.</p>
    <p class="p-c-space">To keep everything organized, I created a Google Sheet that acted as the master source of truth. I divided each recipe into structured fields such as:</p>
        <div class="li-space-1">
            <li>Title</li>
            <li>Bio</li>
            <li>Ingredients</li>
            <li>Cook Time</li>
            <li>Filter Category</li>
            <li>Images (recipe, ingredients, steps)</li>
            <li>Step-by-step instructions</li>            
        </div>
    <p class="p-b-p-space">Once the spreadsheet was complete, I imported it into phpMyAdmin and built my database. I created tables, assigned IDs, matched all images, and checked for missing 
        information. This combined preparation step ensured the site would be able to pull the correct data once I connected everything to PHP.</p>

<h3>Deployment to Production</h3>
    <p class="p-c-space">Once everything was functioning correctly in my local development, I deployed the project through my Westphal domain, and made the website live and accessible.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
    <img class="process" src="images/solution.gif" alt="process hero">
    <p class="p-space">The final outcome is a fully functional, recipe website that transformed a set of static PDFs into an organized, easy-to-browse cooking experience. The homepage displays 
        all recipes in a clean card layout with search and filtering features. Each recipe page presents the bio, ingredients, cook time, step-by-step instructions, and supporting images in a 
        clear, readable format. The design is guided by the custom style sheet I created early in the process to make sure they are in a consistent look across typography, colors, spacing, and 
        icons.</p>
    <p class="p-space">On the development side, the site is functional by PHP and MySQL, pulling all recipe data dynamically from the database I built in phpMyAdmin. As a solo designer and 
        developer, I handled the visual design, front-end structure, database creation, PHP logic, and deployment. The attached GIF demonstrates how the final site works from browsing 
        recipes to viewing detailed steps.</p>

<h2>The Results</h2>
    <p class="p-space">This project was a success because it strengthened my understanding of PHP, MySQL while allowing me to build a fully functioning recipe website from scratch. 
        I met all of the goals I set at the start. Creating a searchable, filterable recipe library, structuring a complete database, and connecting it to a clean, user-friendly interface. 
        Seeing the final site work E2E, from database queries to page rendering, it confirmed that the technical and UX foundations were set up correctly.</p>
    <p class="p-space">A key takeaway and personal challenge from this project was how much clean data and planning impact the development process. Organizing the recipes early on made 
        every coding step smoother, and it's something I would continue doing in future projects. If I were to improve anything, I would add more UX testing to refine the browsing experience 
        even further. Overall, the project helped me grow my technical confidence and showed me how much I enjoy turning messy content into a structured, functional product.</p>
